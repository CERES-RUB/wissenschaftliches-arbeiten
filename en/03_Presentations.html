  <h1 id="sec:presentations">Lectures and Presentations (<em>Vorträge und
Referate</em>)</h1>
<p>In addition to written work, the presentation also plays an important
role in the presentation of academic content. This applies to exchange
between scholars as well as to university-level study or the
communication of academic work to broader publics.</p>
<p>Presentations are a common form of assignment. In order for a
presentation to fulfil its function, a few points must be observed. The
exact design of the presentation can also differ depending on the course
and concept. Therefore, you should discuss the topic and its
delineation, the bibliographical basis, the length of the presentation
and the use of media with the lecturer at an early stage.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-presentations">Types of Presentations</h2>
<p>Presentations can serve different purposes and take different forms,
and the following types can be distinguished:</p>
<p>The aim of a <em>presentation on a text</em> is to present a text
that has either been read by all fellow students or serves as a
supplement to the seminar. It is important to present the text in such a
way that everyone can understand it. The structure of a presentation on
a text follows the general rules of structure (see the section <a href="#sec:presentation_structure">Structure of the Presentation</a>).
However, the main part of a presentation on a text differs from that of
a presentation on a topic:</p>
<p>First, the author of the text should be briefly introduced. It is
important to consider the relevance of biographical data for the
presentation. In any case, it makes sense to mention biographical data,
historical embedding and the context of academic socialization (the
author’s education). In cases of doubt, it is also recommended to
consult with the lecturers.</p>
<p>If the text is an excerpt from a larger work, the work should then be
briefly introduced. If necessary, terms that are important in the
context of the text must be explained before the presentation of the
text itself.</p>
<p>Only then does the presentation of the central content of the text
begin. Here it is particularly important not to engage in retelling: the
presentation introduces the contents of the text that are central and
relevant for the course. It is an individual contribution of the
student, which should go beyond the reproduction of the text. For this
reason, please select the contents you consider important and present
them in a sequence you deem fitting. The comprehensible presentation of
arguments and causal links is more important than following the
structure of the text.</p>
<p>A <em>presentation on a topic</em> gives a short introduction to a
specific topic for the seminar session. The basis of a presentation on a
topic is usually several texts, since what is being presented is not
only the thinking of a single author, but rather a broader topic. The
preparation of a presentation on a topic should therefore also include
the student’s own research on the topic. Here it is particularly
important to discuss with the lecturer what they expect from the
presentation.</p>
<p><em>Preparation of a class or the organization of a session</em>
means engaging an entire seminar session, usually involving not only the
delivery of a presentation but the participation of all those attending
the class. An introduction to the session in the form of a presentation
is suitable, and all forms of presentations can be used. When choosing
this option, you should not forget to consult with the lecturer.</p>
<p>In addition, consideration should be given to the form in which the
participants are involved. The following options are possible, though
this is not an exhaustive list:</p>
<p>– group work with subsequent presentation of the results</p>
<p>– questions about a text</p>
<p>– joint preparation of a text or a topic with the inclusion of black-
or smart boards</p>
<p>– a quiz, for example, at the end of the lesson</p>
<h2 id="sec:presentation_structure">Structure of the Presentation</h2>
<p>Depending on the role of the presentation in the design of the
seminar, presentations can be structured differently. The presentation
should be based on the guidelines. However, there are a few general
points which must be observed.</p>
<p>In principle, a presentation has the same academic demands as other
works. The following requirements, therefore, still apply:</p>
<p>– Formulation of a question or the objective of the presentation.</p>
<p>– Citation of sources by means of a bibliography either in the
handout or at the end of the presentation.</p>
<p>– Critical handling of the relevant texts, sources and terms.</p>
<p>Besides that, however, a presentation has a more introductory
character, resulting in some differences to a written paper. A detailed
presentation of the state of research can usually be left out – what is
more important is the comprehensible communication of the core contents.
The presentation can be based on the following rough outline - from
which, depending on the type of presentation, it is possible to deviate
in individual cases.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Introduction</li>
</ol>
<p>– Beginning: this is your opportunity to arouse the interest of your
listeners. Start with a suitable example, a question about the course, a
link to what has been said in the seminar so far, to general relevant
debates or to some other material - as long as it introduces the
presentation topic in a meaningful way, you are quite free to
choose.</p>
<p>– Presentation of the topic: Don’t just state your topic, but also
your intention. Do you really only want to present the text? Or do you
want to answer more general academic or seminar-related questions? What
is the benefit of your presentation?</p>
<p>– Presentation of the structure: Do not leave your listeners
disoriented. Explain and, if necessary, give reasons for the steps you
follow. This will also help the listeners to get back into the
discussion, should they become distracted at any point. Your outline
should therefore also be supplied in written form, e.g. on the handout.
But you can also give regular verbal “signposts” during the course of
the presentation (“after I have shown that … I will come to the 3rd
point”).</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Main part</li>
</ol>
<p>– Introduction of the relevant authors if necessary. It is seldom
useful to give a whole short presentation on the biographies of the
authors. Rather, this part should be based on what is relevant to the
topic of the presentation as a whole: these are most likely to be
authors’ academic socialization, academic positions and discontinuities
or famous teachers. Biographical data are exciting as long as they
establish a connection to a particular epoch of academic discourse and
are able to better embed positions in terms of content. You may want to
discuss this with the lecturer.</p>
<p>– Central contents of the presentation/the presented text: Never
reproduce complete and uncritically selected contents. Think about what
is really important for the question and objective of the presentation,
as you would when writing a paper. What is the context and the structure
of the argumentation of the text?</p>
<p>– With some (bad) presentations, it becomes clear to all participants
quite quickly that the speakers themselves did not understand the
presented contents in depth. Lines of snippets of content (“and then
Weber says … and then … and then he says …”) show that the argument has
not been understood and therefore cannot be reproduced clearly. This
cardinal error can easily be avoided by dealing with the contents to be
presented at an early stage and then, if necessary, using the
consultation hours of the lecturer to agree on the contents of the
presentation. This is exactly what consultation hours are for, and this
procedure is much more sensible for all participants than suffering
through an inadequate presentation.</p>
<p>– In order to understand a complicated text, you will certainly need
additional information in some places. Consider the information you need
to provide in the presentation to make the material comprehensible.
Important: do not present everything you have read, but only what you
need to explain the content.</p>
<p>– Make an effort to make complex facts comprehensible. Explain them
in your own words or think of specific examples to illustrate the
subject matter.</p>
<div class="Tip">
<p>Sometimes the brief presentation of direct quotations can make sense.
These are easier for the listeners to understand if they are presented
in writing (on the handout or in a visual presentation). If you include
a quotation only verbally, you should make clear that it is a quotation
(“I quote” before the beginning of the quote and a “quote end”
after).</p>
</div>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Conclusion and ending</li>
</ol>
<p>– Criticism of the text: criticism of the text is never bad, as long
as it is well-founded. On the one hand, make it clear where the
criticism comes from - is it your own or the criticism of other authors?
- and explain the basis of the criticism, e.g. the premises of the text,
its conclusions or its methodical implementation.</p>
<p>– Linking back to the context of the course: If the context is not
quite obvious or the presentation has already been embedded by the
lecturer, it can be useful to highlight the connections to the course
again at the end: what was the particular relevance of what you heard?
To what extent have open questions been answered or, on the contrary,
have further points of discussion been raised?</p>
<p>– Do not simply repeat what has already been said, but summarize your
content in a meaningful way by linking it back to the thesis or question
of the presentation and reestablishing the connection to your objective.
The listeners should notice that they are now further along than before,
and it should be clear to the lecturer that you have fulfilled your
intention. Feel free to announce the conclusion explicitly, this will
once again focus attention.</p>
<p>– Give room for questions. Your foundation of literature should be
noted on the handout anyway; but tips for further information can also
find their place here.</p>
<div class="Advice">
<p>Please also clarify beforehand whether you need to close the
presentation with a starting point for discussion. If so, you should
prepare it well so that a discussion can actually get underway - perhaps
with a provocative introductory thesis, the distribution of roles to the
audience, or a controversial example to be discussed. Again, you may
want to discuss this with the lecturer in advance.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="sec:handout">Handout</h2>
<p>A handout should always be submitted for a presentation. It contains
the contents of the presentation in a condensed form and thus serves as
a guide for the presentation as well as a memory aid afterwards. It
should be designed as follows:</p>
<p>– Not overloaded: above all, avoid longer continuous text. The
handout is also not suitable to convey content that is not the subject
of the presentation. An exception may be the reproduction of graphic
representations and/or tables and data; however, these must also be the
subject of the presentation in some form.</p>
<p>– Allowing a recap of the contents of the presentation: therefore, it
should contain largely self-explanatory core theses and, if necessary,
the spelling of (object language) terms and references to
literature.</p>
<p>– With all necessary formalities: title and number of the course,
name of the lecturer and presenter, date of the session in the heading
of the handout, references at the bottom of the document.</p>
<h2 id="ways-of-presenting-and-media">Ways of Presenting and Media</h2>
<h3 id="ways-of-presenting">Ways of Presenting</h3>
<p>The basic difficulty of a presentation is to communicate content that
is well known to the presenter to an audience without less knowledge.
Various means can be used to bridge the gap between presenter and
listener:</p>
<p>– fluid, relaxed delivery</p>
<p>– the involvement of the listeners through questions etc.</p>
<p>– accompanying the presentation with slides/digital presentations
(see section <a href="sec:media">Media</a>).</p>
<p>It is essential to discuss the general conditions before preparing
the presentation: How much time is available for the presentation, is a
subsequent discussion planned, which technical aids can be used if
necessary?</p>
<p>You should use the following guidelines for a presentation:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The estimated time should under no circumstances be exceeded.
Since the length of the presentation is difficult to estimate, the
presentation should be spoken through at least once beforehand and the
duration should be measured during this time. Nothing makes listeners
more inattentive than a presentation that exceeds the session time.
Nothing makes listeners more confused than a presentation that has to be
shortened spontaneously.</p></li>
<li><p>The presentation itself should be well structured: At the
beginning a short overview of the topic and the outline of the
presentation should be given. Central points in the presentation should
be highlighted accordingly. The presentation can be rounded off with a
summary of the core theses at the end. In the case of a presentation on
a text, the structure of the presentation does not have to be the same
as that of the text being presented.</p></li>
<li><p>The presentation should be as free as possible, but secure.
Depending on personal experience and preferences, this can be realized
in different ways. A freely given presentation, which is only based on
key points, is just as possible as an elaborated text. However, a freely
given presentation requires some practice in order not to become unsure.
When presenting from a well-formulated script, on the other hand, care
should be taken not to read the text monotonously, but to maintain
contact with the audience. A good compromise is often a well-formulated
script with highlighted keywords.</p></li>
<li><p>You should also think about your opening and closing remarks.
This often gets lost in the preparation, because you concentrate on the
supposedly more important contents; but this is where you get to set the
expectations of the listeners and afterwards once again emphasizes the
results and the importance of the presentation.</p></li>
<li><p>The language of a presentation is different from that of a
written paper. Sentences should be short and understandable, technical
terms should be avoided or briefly explained. Short insertions at the
speaker level can draw the attention of the listeners, e.g. “I now come
to the second part of the presentation” or “In conclusion I would like
to summarize the central points again”.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="Tip">
<p>A large part of the optimization of your own style of presentation is
achieved through repeated presentations. In addition, feedback from
fellow students or lecturers will also help you. You should therefore
seek feedback on your presentation as soon as possible while the
impressions are still fresh. Do this proactively - not every lecturer
considers institutionalized feedback to all presenters.</p>
</div>
<div class="Tip">
<p>Are you nervous? This is normal. But it usually helps to be really
well prepared - and also the routine that comes with the course of
study. If you have the feeling that this is not enough for you, you can
get professional help - almost every university offers a workshop where
you can practice academic writing and presenting as well as a
counselling service for cases of exam nerves. Make use of this if you
think it could help you. For more information see <a class="uri" href="https://studium.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en/counselling">https://studium.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en/counselling</a> or
find some English workshops at <a class="uri" href="https://www.zfw.rub.de/sz/mini-workshops">https://www.zfw.rub.de/sz/mini-workshops</a>. At <a class="email" href="mailto:schreibberatung@rub.de">schreibberatung@rub.de</a> you can also ask for
counselling on academic writing.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="sec:media">Media</h3>
<p>It should always be considered which form of media makes sense and
which is applicable in the room you are using. A visual presentation for
the listener is more pleasant than one in which only the content is
rattled off.</p>
<p>There are several media available to support the presentation, all of
which have their advantages and disadvantages:</p>
<p>A handout is the least that should be used as media support. It makes
it easier for the listeners to follow the presentation and can be used
later as a reminder. For more details see the section <a href="#sec:handout">Handout</a>.</p>
<p>A blackboard or whiteboard is particularly suitable for procedural
participation and whenever certain points need to be developed during
the presentation. The disadvantage is that it is not usually preserved
and cannot always be prepared. It is possible to make use of the
whiteboard by taking pictures of it and making them accessible to the
participants.</p>
<p>Additional notes during the presentation are possible and also a
duplication can be made very easily with overhead projector slides.
However, slides can get mixed up and rob the presenter of their flow.
Also, the necessary equipment is no longer available in all university
rooms.</p>
<p>A good on-screen presentation usually allows the presenter to speak
more freely. Recourse to media such as sound, pictures, videos and links
is also possible without problems. If necessary, editing can be done
very quickly.</p>
<p>However, a bad on-screen presentation can have a negative influence
on the quality of the presentation, which is often the case if the
slides are overloaded. In addition, technical problems can occur, which
is why a plan B without computer and projector should always be
available just to be sure.</p>
<p>For more details see the section <a href="08_Visual_Presentation.html#sec:visual_presentation">Visual
Presentation</a>.</p>
<p>In general, the various types of media can be combined at any
time.</p>
<div class="Remember">
<p><strong>Before the presentation</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What does the lecturer expect from my presentation?</li>
<li>Which media are available to me in the seminar room?</li>
<li>Which media support is most useful for my presentation?</li>
<li>If there are co-presenters, what is the best way to arrange the
presentation?</li>
<li>How much time do I have for my presentation?</li>
<li>Am I well prepared?</li>
<li>Have I practiced (with someone else or in front of the mirror)?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>During the presentation</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Do I speak in such a way that everyone understands me (both
acoustically and in terms of content)?</li>
<li>Do I keep eye-contact with all listeners?</li>
<li>Do I explain complex issues in such a way that everyone can follow
me (with examples or comparisons)?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>After the presentation</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Did I get feedback from the lecturer?</li>
<li>What can I do better next time?</li>
