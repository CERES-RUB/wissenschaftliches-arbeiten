  <h1 id="sec:literature_administration">Literature Administration</h1>
<p>The administration of literature and the citation of texts represents
a large part of the effort involved in writing an academic paper. This
is already shown by the length of the corresponding chapter in this
introduction. However, there are also programs that make this work much
easier. Literature administration software offers the possibility,</p>
<ul>
<li><p>to keep your own literature collection under control (e.g. to
find copies from previous seminars by searching for title, author or
keywords),</p></li>
<li><p>to have a bibliography formatted according to specific
requirements and</p></li>
<li><p>for literature references in a text to be automatically formatted
and the creation of a list of the literature used.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are a number of both free and payment-requiring programs for
these tasks. Most providers of commercial programs provide free versions
(often with reduced functionality) for students. The Ruhr-Universität
has a campus license for the program “Citavi”, so students can also use
the full version free of charge.</p>
<p>One of the most common literature management programs is Endnote. The
program charges a fee and has had some problems of downward
compatibility in the past (old databases could not be processed by new
versions without effort).</p>
<p>With Zotero (<a class="uri" href="https://www.zotero.org/">https://www.zotero.org/</a>) completely free literature
management is available, which can be used free of charge even when one
is no longer a student, in contrast to Citavi. It works with both MacOSX
and Linux.</p>
<p>Literature administration software often offers many possibilities.
Of course, not all of them have to be used. The following lists the
usual steps for using literature administration software.</p>
<p><strong>Citavi</strong></p>
<p>Citavi is a literature administration program that is installed as a
program on your own PC. Citavi is generally available for a fee; the
“Citavi Free” version is free of charge, although only 100 titles can be
entered. The RUB also provides a free full version for all employees and
students, which is available at <a class="uri" href="https://www.it-services.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/services/software/citavi.html">https://www.it-services.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/services/software/citavi.html</a>
(<em>in German</em>). Citavi can therefore only be used to its full
extent free of charge as long as you are a student or employee of the
RUB. The data sets entered therein can, however, be exported and
transferred to other literature administrations with a moderate effort.
Citavi impresses with its intuitive usability and its broad functions
(idea and excerpt management, to-do lists, etc.). Preset citation styles
are available, these can be easily modified or supplemented. In case of
problems the support of the software producer is available.</p>
<p>Citavi can currently only be used with Windows. A version for Mac and
a server-based version, which can also be used with Linux without
restrictions, are planned or in progress, but have not yet been
released.</p>
<p>Further information can be found at <a class="uri" href="http://www.citavi.com/">http://www.citavi.com/</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Zotero</strong></p>
<p>Zotero is a literature administration program developed in
cooperation with universities and other public institutions which is
available free of charge as open-source software. Zotero runs directly
in the Firefox web browser, making it possible to import literature
references from a number of library catalogs, databases and other
websites. Plugins are available for Microsoft Word and LibreOffice
Writer, which make it very easy to cite directly in the text and create
automatic bibliographies. Zotero has a large number of citation styles,
but creating your own styles requires deeper knowledge.</p>
<p>Zotero can be downloaded from <a class="uri" href="https://www.zotero.org/">https://www.zotero.org/</a>.</p>
<h2 id="collecting-bibliographic-references">Collecting Bibliographic
References</h2>
<figure>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Entry in a literature
database</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The first step is to collect bibliographic data in the literature
database. For this purpose, the information of a book, journal article
or other text source is entered in general form. The later formatting
does not play a role here. If the author is entered as “Weber, Max”,
this can later be rendered “Weber, Max”, “Max Weber” or “Weber, M.”. The
separation of meaning and formatting is similar to the formatting
templates of a word processor, only the possibilities are much greater
here.</p>
<p>It makes sense to link the collected references with the
corresponding copy or file. In this way, it is easy to find a text that
you read a long time ago. In principle, this is the structure of a small
private library. Each copy must be provided with a short signature
(e.g. author and year of publication), which corresponds to the
signature in the literature administration. If the copies are then filed
according to signature, the matching text for an entry in the literature
database can be found easily. In the case of electronic documents, this
is usually even easier; here, the corresponding file can often be opened
from the literature administration by pressing a button.</p>
<p>In connection with internet catalogs, some programs offer the
possibility to import the literature data directly. This saves a lot of
typing work, for example if an entry from a library catalog can be
directly transferred to the literature administration.</p>
<h2 id="output-of-literature">Output of Literature</h2>
<p>An important piece of work is taken off your hands if you leave the
formatting of literature lists to the literature administration. This
has several advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It is much faster,</p></li>
<li><p>the same literature list can easily be output in a completely
different format,</p></li>
<li><p>one avoids careless mistakes and inconsistencies.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For this purpose, the programs usually provide a selection of
ready-made formatting rules; if desired, you can create your own.</p>
<div class="Tip">
<p>If one uses such a program, it is usually sufficient to select a
style that comes close to the specifications of the department. It is
not necessary to create a style that exactly implements the
guidelines.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="embedding-in-word-processing">Embedding in Word Processing</h2>
<p>Most literature administration programs also offer the possibility to
embed references directly into a document. In this way, not only the
formatting of the bibliography can be controlled, but also the
formatting of the references in the text. In addition, a list of the
literature used in the text can be created automatically.</p>
<p>Usually Microsoft Word and often LibreOffice are supported by the
commercial literature administration programs. LaTeX has its own
literature management system, BibTeX, which is tightly integrated into
LaTeX. The newer bibLaTeX also supports the more complicated conventions
of the humanities.</p>
