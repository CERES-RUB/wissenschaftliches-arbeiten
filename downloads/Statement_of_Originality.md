2. not used any resources other than those listed in the list of sources, bibliography and aids, and in the notes;
3. fully identified all sections that were written with the help of software based on so-called artificial intelligence (especially from the field of large language models, e.g., but not exclusively, ChatGPT);
4. listed software based on so-called artificial intelligence that I have used to collect ideas, draft text structure, and improve spelling, grammar or punctuation, with details of the tool used, the date and scope of use, as well as the prompts and possibly a brief explanation in the list of aids;
5. marked as quotation all passages in the text that are taken from other works either verbatim or in meaning, stating the source; this includes all sources, including in particular all information from the Internet.

\noindent
Furthermore, I expressly declare that I

1. have not submitted this work (in this or an equivalent form in terms of content) or parts thereof elsewhere;
2. will not submit this work (in this or an equivalent form) or parts thereof elsewhere;

4. take responsibility for my text and can explain it and the process of its creation on request;
5. am aware that plagiarism or plagiarized sections of text in my thesis will result in my thesis being assessed as "failed (intent to deceive)" and reported to the relevant examination board and that this may result in further sanctions (e.g. fine, exmatriculation) depending on the severity of the violation;
6. am aware that the undeclared or unauthorized use of generative AI in examinations is considered and treated as academic malpractice analogous to plagiarism.
