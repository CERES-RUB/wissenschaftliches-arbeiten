  <h1 id="sec:term_papers">Term Papers (<em>Hausarbeiten</em>)</h1>
<h2 id="sec:steps">Steps of Academic Writing</h2>
<p>The writing of an academic paper is not limited to the writing of the
text itself. Both before and after this there are a number of important
steps that must be taken into account when planning a paper.</p>
<h3 id="time-management">Time-Management</h3>
<p>It is advisable to work out a schedule for the paper before starting
the writing process. Especially when it comes to the locating and review
of relevant literature, this can often take more time than might be
initially assumed. If the required books have been borrowed by someone
else or even have to be ordered via interlibrary loan, it can take
several weeks until they are available. The further steps also take
time. And last but not least, there should be enough time at the end to
proofread the work (or have it proofread).</p>
<p>An overall schedule can be helpful for the coordination of different
assignments, for example during the semester breaks. It enables more
effective use of the limited time available. In addition, a schedule can
have motivating effects by showing the points already successfully
completed during the course of writing a paper.</p>
<div class="Advice">
<p>Papers are usually written during the semester break. Please bear in
mind that during this time office hours are often offered at different
times and/or less frequently, and lecturers may also be on holiday. If
necessary, it is therefore best to arrange consultation appoint-ments at
the end of the teaching period.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="finding-a-topic-and-formulating-a-question">Finding a Topic and
Formulating a Question</h3>
<p>The first step in writing an academic paper is to find a topic. In so
doing, it is not enough only to identify the issues which the paper will
address. It is also necessary to formulate a question that makes it
possible to work on the topic with an approach specific to religious
studies. Developing a research question is certainly a demanding task. A
good question does not usually stop at asking how things can be
described (this usually results in a simple reproduction of one’s
readings with no critical input), rather an academic question aims at
explaining the facts or their consequences. An exception to this can be
language-focused research, where the reading and representation of the
material is a demanding task in itself.</p>
<p>A second challenge is to narrow down the subject. Topics such as “The
History of Hinduism in India” or “The Religiosity of Muslim Youth in
Germany” are simply too broad to be dealt with in the context of term
papers or even a Bachelor’s thesis. The identification of a topic is
also difficult because it requires basic knowledge of the subject in
advance. Only then is it possible to determine the more concrete
questions into which a topic can be broken down.</p>
<p>Therefore, finding the right topic cannot be done at the desk alone.
It requires an initial, rough overview of the available literature and
the state of research, as well as conversation with the lecturer. Do not
hesitate to tell the lecturer your own ideas, but also be prepared to
listen. If you have already acquired some basic knowledge, you can take
up the lecturer’s suggestions and work them in sensibly.</p>
<div class="Tip">
<p>Often you can start from a problem that you have encountered in a
seminar or even outside the university. For your paper it is essential
to make the problem manageable by formulating a clear question. It can
be helpful to create a mind map on which you try to set out and
structure different aspects of the topic. You only have to concentrate
on one of these aspects - the more precise and narrow your question
becomes, the easier it will be to work on it.</p>
</div>
<div class="Example">
<p>The definition of a ‘religious community’ is apparently
controversial, as the debate on Scientology shows. The question “What is
a religious community?” would be too broad to be answered in a term
paper. Moreover, normative approaches - for instance “Why Scientology is
not a religious community” - are inappropriate in academic papers. It
would be possible to raise a question that picks out one of many
aspects, namely the legal debate surrounding this issue: “Which
argumentations are used in court decisions about the recognition of
religious communities?” The title of the paper could then be: “Judicial
argumentations in determining the status of ‘religious community’. An
investigation into the example of Scientology.”</p>
</div>
<h3 id="outline-and-selection-of-literature">Outline and Selection of
Literature</h3>
<p>An initial outline can be established immediately after the research
question has been formulated. This allows one to explicate the basic
scheme of the work without getting lost in the details of the material.
The outline is also the basis for the selection of literature. Only when
the approximate direction of the research is known is it possible to
then determine which literature is relevant. In addition to literature
on the subject, it is often necessary to have an insight into the
theoretical literature in order to provide a background for the research
question. In a second part of the assignment, depending on the focus of
the topic, students can analyse their own selection of sources.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p>The outline of your Scientology term paper might now look like
this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Introduction</p></li>
<li><p>(Descriptive part)</p>
<p>2.1 About Scientology</p>
<p>2.2 Overview of conflicts and court trials that have taken
place</p></li>
<li><p>(Analytical part)</p>
<p>3.1 Analysis of documents and legal rulings</p>
<p>3.2 Reference to religious studies literature on Scientology</p></li>
<li><p>Conclusion</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>For more details, see the section on <a href="#sec:outline">Outline
of Chapters</a>.</p>
<h3 id="literature-consultation-and-reading">Literature Consultation and
Reading</h3>
<p>Sufficient time should be planned for the literature consultation.
Relevant works may already be on loan or even have to be ordered via
interlibrary loan. It is therefore advisable to acquire an overview of
the required literature at an early stage. (For details of this process,
see the section on <a href="04_Literature.html#sec:literature_consultation">Literature
Consultation</a>.) The range of inquiry is always the current state of
research: the texts on a topic are not chosen arbitrarily, but should
reflect the particular research area. Of course, it is not possible to
reproduce the entire literature on a topic in one paper. However, the
selected texts should always be embedded in a context: Which research
area do they originate from? To which texts and/or authors do they
refer? What other research areas are there that are not considered in
the paper? A short overview of the state of research and the existing
literature should therefore always be presented at the beginning of your
text, for example after the introduction.</p>
<p>The actual work then follows with the reading and evaluation of the
selected literature. Again, it is important not to rush into the
literature without prior consideration. The reading should also be done
with the research question in mind. What kind of argument does the
author pursue? Does it agree with your own approaches? If not, can your
own approach be justified or should you adapt your theses?</p>
<p>For more details see the sections on <a href="04_Literature.html#sec:literature_consultation">Literature
Consultation</a> and <a href="04_Literature.html#sec:reading_techniques">Reading
Techniques</a>.</p>
<h3 id="writing-the-paper">Writing the Paper</h3>
<p>Most of the work is done with the writing of the actual text of your
assignment. However, if the previous steps have been thoroughly
completed, the effort involved in the actual writing of the paper is
reduced considerably. Ideally, one should have a clear question and a
clear outline, know the literature and just need to get started. One
should not only have the layout of the chapters in mind, but also the
rough structure of the argument. In this way any weaknesses in structure
will become apparent early on, and not only after the assignment has
been written.</p>
<div class="Tip">
<p>Write out a basic plan of your term paper, including the structure of
your arguments. This will make it much easier to write. You can also
include the literature to be used and/or any especially appropriate
quotations.</p>
</div>
<p>After writing the text, you have to spend some time on
post-processing. The text should at least be proofread for consistency
of content and for any formal errors (spelling, grammar). It is helpful
to have someone else proofread the text, because after having worked on
it for some time, one becomes blind to many flaws and errors.</p>
<div class="Technology">
<p>Appearance, i.e. a neat layout, is also part of an academic paper.
Here, too, you can reduce subsequent work to a minimum if you work
properly from the start. This includes creating an automatically
generated table of contents and bibliography. For more details see the
sections on <a href="06_Word_Processing.html#sec:word_processing">Word
Processing</a> and <a href="07_Literature_Administration.html#sec:literature_administration">Literature
Administration</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="sec:structure">Structure of a Paper</h2>
<p>A term paper must meet certain formal criteria. In addition, there
are a number of guidelines regarding the structure, which should be
followed.</p>
<h3 id="cover-sheet">Cover Sheet</h3>
<p>At the front of each term paper there must be a cover sheet
containing several important pieces of information. The cover sheet
should present this information as clearly as possible. It must
contain:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Name of the university, faculty and subject of study</p></li>
<li><p>purpose of the paper (e.g. “Term Paper as Module Examination …”
or “essay as examination for the module part …”)</p></li>
<li><p>title, course number and semester of the seminar/module as well
as the names of the lecturers</p></li>
<li><p>title of the paper</p></li>
<li><p>name, matriculation number, combination of subjects, number of
semesters, address, telephone number, and email address</p></li>
<li><p>date on which the work is submitted</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The figure shows an example of a cover sheet.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Example of a cover sheet" src="images/Muster_Cover_Sheet.svg"/>
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example of a cover sheet</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="table-of-contents">Table of Contents</h3>
<p>The table of contents contains the chapters and subchapters of the
paper with page numbers. The table of contents itself should not be
listed. Many word processing programs support the automatic creation of
a table of contents. For more information, see the section on <a href="06_Word_Processing.html#sec:word_processing">Word
Processing</a>.</p>
<h3 id="sec:outline">Outline of Chapters</h3>
<p>Each paper consists of an introduction, a main body and a conclusion.
In the introduction the topic of the paper, the question and the
structure of the paper are presented. Thus, the reader can already
anticipate a certain structure and does not have to deduce it from the
text. The main body then contains a sketch of the literature or the
state of research and, as the most important part, the student’s actual
work on the topic. Finally, the text is briefly summarized once again
and the main findings are noted. The conclusion contains no new
information or arguments.</p>
<p>However, this structure generally does not fully correspond to the
outline of chapters. While the introduction is often called
“Introduction”, and the conclusion is likely to be found under the
heading “Conclusion” or similar, the main part usually consists of
several chapters. The chapters of the main part should reflect the
structure of the paper well and be named accordingly, so that the
outline of the chapters already gives a good impression of the main
topics. Sub-chapters can be divided into smaller sections, but the
outline should not be too detailed. In practice, it is often best to
divide the main section into three parts, but this is only a rule of
thumb: the chapters and sub-chapters should not be unconnected but
should be linked together in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>Decimal classification is suitable for the outline of chapters:
chapters numbered with 1, 2, and so on, sub-chapters with 1.1, 1.2, etc.
An outline level must never contain only a single chapter: If there is a
chapter 2.1, then there must also be 2.2.</p>
<p>The individual parts should roughly follow the following
structure:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Introduction to the topic, for example by linking it to
historical or general debates</p></li>
<li><p>Presentation of the subsequent topic of the paper and, if
applicable, reasons for the choice of topic</p></li>
<li><p>Limitation of the subject area: which aspect of the problem is
relevant and can be treated meaningfully in the context of the paper,
and which aspects must be left out?</p></li>
<li><p>Formulation of a research question or project, explication and
justification (e.g., research gap, relevance for research in religious
studies, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Description of the procedure and structure of the paper</p></li>
<li><p>Short overview of the literature used in the context of the state
of research and possibly the sources</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="Tip">
<p>Imagine the introduction of a paper as being like a funnel: you start
broadly, with a reference to a generally relevant issue, and then narrow
it down to your chosen problem. This approach has its counterpart in the
conclusion - here the findings of the paper are again opened up into a
more general debate.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><p>Presentation and execution of the preceding arguments, answering
the question raised in the introduction.</p></li>
<li><p>Reproduce the researched and selected literature and discuss
divergent approaches and arguments; do not retell the content, but
select specific focal points based on the question posed.</p></li>
<li><p>Back up your statements with meaningful examples and quotations;
pay attention to the corresponding citations in the footnotes.</p></li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><p>Summarize the presentation and argumentation of the text briefly,
and gather everything together in the formulation of a result that you
have arrived at.</p></li>
<li><p>If necessary (especially in empirical work), critically reflect
on your own approach: Was the method useful? Has anything remained open
or unclear?</p></li>
<li><p>Concluding statement on the topic: significance of your own
results - both for your specific question and for the general
topic.</p></li>
<li><p>Outlook regarding further questions which your work could not
answer or which your results have raised for further research.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="Advice">
<p>The conclusion does not provide any new information that has not
already been dealt with in the main part (citations are therefore
generally no longer necessary here).</p>
</div>
<div class="Tip">
<p>If you have written a neatly structured introduction, you can now
“backtrack” the other way round - from the specifics of your work to the
generalities of a larger debate. In any case, it is important that you
refer to the introduction - in this way you make your work coherent and
make it clear to the reader that you have written a well-structured and
precise academic paper.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="bibliography-and-appendices">Bibliography and Appendices</h3>
<p>At the end of the paper there should be a complete list of all
literature used. The bibliography should not be filled up with
literature that is not cited in the text. If a publication is important
in terms of content, it should be cited, otherwise it does not have to
be included in the bibliography. For the formatting of the bibliography
see the section <a href="05_Citing_Literature.html#sec:citing">Citing
Literature</a>.</p>
<p>Papers that are rich in material can also contain one or more
appendices, in which e.g. illustrations, source texts or similar can be
placed. The appendices do not count for determining the length of the
paper.</p>
<h3 id="formatting">Formatting</h3>
<p>A term paper in standard format usually contains about 12-18 pages or
5,000-7,000 words. However, the obligatory details are determined by the
lecturers. The following guidelines apply to all papers:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>font size 12pt</p></li>
<li><p>line spacing 1.25 to 1.5</p></li>
<li><p>Right margin 4cm - for notes and corrections; left margin 2cm,
top/bottom 2-3cm</p></li>
<li><p>Detached headings with section numbers</p></li>
<li><p>Footnotes at the bottom of the page (no endnotes)</p></li>
<li><p>Page numbering from the second page onwards (the title page
counts as page 1, but should not have a page number on it)</p></li>
<li><p>Text in justification with (automatic) hyphenation</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="Technology">
<p>For formatting a term paper with common word processing programs see
section <a href="06_Word_Processing.html#sec:word_processing">Word
Processing</a>.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="language">Language</h3>
<p>Good linguistic expression is also part of a successful paper.
Contrary to common assumptions, language is not more academic if it uses
many foreign words and complex sentences. The use of technical terms
should make a text more precise and - for experts in the field,
including the markers - more comprehensible, not less comprehensible.
Above all, make sure that you yourself understand what you are
writing.</p>
<p>Be precise and specify to whom you are referring, e.g. by saying:
“The author considers that …”. Likewise, you should avoid the first
person when you present facts or others’ theories; the first person is
reserved for your own arguments or opinions.</p>
<p>Write in a clear way such that no more words could be deleted from
your sentences. Filler words like “actually”, “quite”, “to a certain
extent” or ” eventually” take away persuasive power from your arguments
because they weaken their significance. It is better to write your work
in such a way that all statements are fully intended as they are written
there. If there are limitations to be considered, they should be made
explicit and explained.</p>
<p>The argumentation of the work should also be reflected in the
language: Causal links are an important means of connecting your
arguments conclusively. However, a common mistake is to make causal
links in places where they do not belong. Check very carefully whether
sentences or parts of sentences that start with “therefore”,
“nevertheless”, “in view of” or other phrases that refer to what has
preceded them really do relate appropriately and clearly to what
precedes.</p>
<p>Particularly with longer sentences, it is easy to come across
incorrect grammatical constructions. Make sure that all formulations,
connectors and relations are correct. It is also important to have
correct and consistent orthography and punctuation.</p>
<p>For improved readability, the text should be structured with
paragraphs. However, a new paragraph should be deliberately added when a
new aspect is addressed. Putting each sentence in a separate paragraph
is just as unhelpful as a text without paragraphs.</p>
<h2 id="sec:marking">Marking Criteria for Term Papers</h2>
<p>CERES lecturers follow a catalogue of criteria when marking written
work. This will be made transparent in order to enable students to
self-evaluate their written performance and to make the grading of their
work comprehensible.</p>
<p>Generally, the work of the early phases of study should already try
to follow this standard. However, these criteria are only applied in
their entirety from the BA thesis onwards. The criteria are as
follows:</p>
<p>– Quality of research – Expertise – Level of reflection – Consistency
of argumentation – Judgement – Originality – Form</p>
<p>The evaluation of these criteria is best illustrated using binary
positive/negative pairs as follows:</p>
<table>

<h2 id="plagiarism">Plagiarism</h2>
<p>In the field of academia - in which you are also involved as a
student - it is no longer a trivial offence to pass off someone else’s
intellectual property as your own thoughts. Plagiarism is now severely
punished at all universities. At the Ruhr-Universität Bochum the
following applies: Not only are all papers in which plagiarism can be
found considered “insufficient”, but plagiarism must also be reported to
the examination office and thus to the legal department. The latter can
initiate punitive administrative proceedings to impose fines and, in
serious cases, result in exclusion from university.</p>
<p>In the academic world, plagiarism includes various offences:
submitting a work that someone else has written for the student
(ghostwriting) or submitting someone else’s work under one’s own name
(full plagiarism), taking text from other works - or from the Internet -
without citation (partial plagiarism) or submitting one’s own work
several times on different occasions (self-plagiarism).</p>
<p>It is therefore also extremely important to correctly cite and
substantiate any passages from other works - without adequate citation,
even adapted and possibly slightly modified paraphrases from the works
of other authors become plagiarism.</p>
<div class="Advice">
<p>It is also important for the marking of your work that you clearly
mark which ideas you have taken from another work and which are your own
analysis or conclusions. Your personal contribution is an important part
of a paper, so you are not doing yourself any favors if you leave the
marker unsure about what your personal contribution is.</p>
</div>
<div class="Tip">
<p>If you indirectly quote the argument of another author over longer
stretches, you should make this clear by using the subjunctive in
addition to the use of clearly indicated evidence. You can emphasize
your part in the work by using clear formulations at the important
points (“I have shown that …”; “One can now conclude that …”).</p>
