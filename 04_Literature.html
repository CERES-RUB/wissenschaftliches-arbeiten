  <h1 id="sec:literature">How to Deal with Literature</h1>
<h2 id="sec:literature_consultation">Literature Consultation</h2>
<p>The literature consultation for a paper, a presentation or any other
work is an important part of the assignment. Therefore, this research
should be carried out on one’s own. Finding, viewing and evaluating the
available literature is an important skill acquired during the course of
study. However, after you have conducted an initial survey, you can (and
should) discuss your findings with the lecturer. In this way you also
avoid reading too many texts that you cannot use in the end.</p>
<p>When researching the literature, it is important to avoid two common
problems: First, it is easy to find too much literature. On the other
hand, there is also the danger of not finding important texts that may
not immediately catch the eye. It is therefore important to start the
search from different places in order to find not necessarily a lot of
literature, but appropriate literature. There is not a single catalog
where you can find all the relevant literature, so it is important to
know the different search methods.</p>
<p>There are two possible strategies for finding literature, which can
also be combined:</p>
<p><em>Top-down</em> research starts with general overviews: for
example, subject-specific bibliographies (you can often find
corresponding bibliographies on the websites of individual institutes)
or encyclopedias. There you will get an overview of the basic literature
relevant to a given subject, such that you are less likely to overlook
something important. For more specific literature, however, you need
other sources.</p>
<p>The <em>bottom-up</em> strategy starts with the texts already known
to you (from courses or through previous research). The bibliographies
of monographs, essays and articles can then serve as a starting point
for further research. This makes it possible to obtain a broad overview
of a specific topic. The author’s expertise is used to distinguish
relevant from less relevant literature. Qualification papers in
particular (such as dissertations) usually provide a good overview of
the state of research on a topic. In addition, one can find important
literature that might not otherwise have been found by a free search in
the library catalog.</p>
<h3 id="encyclopedias">Encyclopedias</h3>
<p>A first good introduction to finding literature is provided by
encyclopedias relevant to religious studies. The articles offer a brief
overview of a topic, and they usually contain a series of relevant
bibliographical references at the end of the article. These can be used
for a more detailed study.</p>
<p>Please note, however, that a paper should never be based solely on
encyclopedia articles. In addition, some of the encyclopedias (or the
individual volumes) are older, so you cannot rely on finding up-to-date
references there. Some reliable encyclopedias for religious studies
are:</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="library-catalogs">Library Catalogs</h3>
<p>The library catalogs are a good place to look for monographs in
particular. The catalog of the Ruhr-Universität can be reached at <a class="uri" href="http://www.ub.rub.de/">http://www.ub.rub.de/</a>.</p>
<p>However, not all books are available in the University Library.
Therefore, it is worthwhile to search the catalogs of the library
associations and to order books via inter-library loan if necessary. The
university libraries in North Rhine-Westphalia have joined together to
form HBZ (<a class="uri" href="http://www.hbz-nrw.de/">http://www.hbz-nrw.de/</a> <em>in German</em>). The catalog
KatalogPLUS on the page of the RUB library (<a class="uri" href="http://www.ub.rub.de/">http://www.ub.rub.de/</a>)
allows you to search in various libraries.</p>
<div class="Advice">
<p>Library catalogs are generally not suitable for finding articles in
anthologies or journals. Accordingly, a literature search should not be
limited to the library catalog alone.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Tips for research</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>In library catalogs you usually search for literature by
keywords. Remember to find synonyms for your topic and possibly try
keywords in different languages. Your topic can be very specific;
consider under which keywords you might find publications that deal with
this topic (for example, if you are looking for literature on the
definition of religious communities, you will not necessarily find a
book with the same title - in an “Introduction to the Sociology of
Religion”, on the other hand, you will certainly find
something).</p></li>
<li><p>Library catalogs themselves also work with keywords. These can be
found in the details of a book. Perhaps one of them fits your topic well
- you can find out with a simple click which books the library staff
have marked with this keyword. The advantage of this is that you don’t
have to rely on your search term appearing in the title of a book - the
keywords can also cover general topics or content.</p></li>
<li><p>Have you found a current dissertation or habilitation thesis on
the topic? Lucky hit! Because these theses usually contain a detailed
state of research on their topic themselves, which should include all
relevant publications.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have found a relevant book, you should also look to the
right and left of it on the shelf. As a rule, thematically related books
are grouped together, so that you can find books here that you might not
have found in the catalog.</p></li>
<li><p>Be sure to take part in an introduction to the university library
and library catalogs at the beginning of your studies. These guided
tours are usually free of charge and regularly offered by library
staff.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="literature-databases">Literature Databases</h3>
<p>Literature databases are a suitable means of obtaining information on
individual articles. An overview of the literature databases to which
the RUB offers access can be found at <a class="uri" href="http://www.ub.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/DigiBib/Datenbank/Gesamt.htm">http://www.ub.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/DigiBib/Datenbank/Gesamt.htm</a>.
The databases <em>ATLA</em>, <em>Philosopher’s Index</em> and
<em>Sociological Abstracts</em> are of particular interest for the study
of religions.</p>
<p>Some literature databases offer the possibility to directly access
the online holdings of journals. This is, of course, very convenient, as
it saves you the trouble of searching for the journal, copying it or
even an inter-library loan. However, it should not be the criterion for
literature selection whether a journal is available online.</p>
<div class="Technology">
<p>Some literature databases can only be accessed from the RUB campus
network. It is therefore best to carry out your research from a campus
computer or connect to the university network from outside via VPN. You
can find instructions for this at <a class="uri" href="http://www.ub.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/DigiBib/zugang-extern.html.en">http://www.ub.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/DigiBib/zugang-extern.html.en</a>.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="online-sources">Online Sources</h3>
<p>There is also the possibility of an internet research. However,
please make sure to apply the same standards of quality to online
sources as you would to printed works. Some internet services offer a
convenient way to find literature, similar to literature databases, for
example Google Scholar (<a class="uri" href="https://scholar.google.de/">https://scholar.google.de/</a>).</p>
<p>However, a number of internet-based sources are not suitable for
academic use. This includes, above all, Wikipedia. In an academic work
you should not quote Wikipedia! Many Internet sites are also more likely
to be the subject of academic research than a source. This largely
applies to the online output of religious communities.</p>
<h3 id="comprehensive-search-digibib">Comprehensive search: DigiBib</h3>
<p>With the DigiBib of the HBZ (<a class="uri" href="http://www.digibib.net/">http://www.digibib.net/</a>) a search option is available,
which can search several of the mentioned sources simultaneously.
Library catalogs, journal article databases and electronic full texts
are searched. A search in the DigiBib thus already covers some of the
above-mentioned search options under a uniform search interface. This
makes the DigiBib a good starting point for a comprehensive literature
search. Other sources should nevertheless be considered.</p>
<div class="Tip">
<p>If you document your search process, you may save yourself some work.
Note down the search keywords you have used and make a list of all books
found and considered in the catalog. On this list you should note which
book was unexpectedly useless, which was perhaps out of place, and which
still needs to be acquired. In this way you can save yourself going back
to the shelf for a new search and expand the pool of already searched
keywords in the case of an in-depth search.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="sec:reading">Reading and Understanding Literature</h2>
<h3 id="how-to-organize-literature">How to Organize Literature</h3>
<p>An important skill that you will need to learn during your studies is
the skillful handling of large amounts of academic literature and a
quick and reliable assessment of its utility for your needs. This is
also a matter of practice; however, we would like to give you some tips
at this point:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You can already see from the cover and/or the table of contents
what the aim of the book is: is it a research study or a teaching book;
does it provide an overview or does it go into a topic in
depth?</p></li>
<li><p>A basic rule: not everything that can be found in university
libraries is of high academic quality. Here you will find both
publications of popular science as well as normative publications of a
specific publisher. Always critically examine the premises, style and
argumentation of a work.</p></li>
<li><p>Who is the author of the selected work? From what discipline or
school are they from? What else have they published and what are their
main areas of work?</p></li>
<li><p>When is the publication date? Is it sufficiently current for the
topic? Does it possibly originate from a context/era that might affect
its arguments (e.g. colonialism, National Socialism)?</p></li>
<li><p>In which series or publishing house did the publication appear or
in which journal did the article appear? What does this series/ this
publishing house/ this journal stand for? Who is the editor?</p></li>
<li><p>How detailed, up-to-date and academic is the bibliography? To
which disciplines does the author refer?</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sec:reading_techniques">Reading Techniques</h3>
<p>Not only writing but also reading academic texts must be practiced.
Depending on your interests and requirements, different forms of reading
can be applied. Before reading, one should therefore consider what goals
are associated with reading a text. This determines the general
conditions of the reading:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Is the text course literature, the basis for a paper or exam
content?</p></li>
<li><p>Is the text only of interest due certain of its contents, or is
it a general overview?</p></li>
<li><p>What previous knowledge on the topic of the text is already
available?</p></li>
<li><p>How much time can be spent on reading?</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="sec:analytical_reading">Analytical Reading</h4>
<p>The most important reading method is analytical reading. The aim is
to understand all central concepts of a text and to work out the theses
and trains of thought. A critical approach to the text should be taken,
and both successful aspects and weaknesses should be uncovered. The
so-called PQ4R formula can be helpful in this process:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>P</strong>review: First overview of the text</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Q</strong>uestion: Formulate questions directed to the
text</p></li>
<li><p><strong>R</strong>ead: Read the text</p></li>
<li><p><strong>R</strong>eflect: Reflect upon the contents and their
context</p></li>
<li><p><strong>R</strong>ecite: Reproduce the content (e.g. in form of a
summary)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>R</strong>eview: Review of your own reading</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When reading the text, it is useful to work with markings and notes
in the margins. In this way, important and unimportant things are
distinguished from each other while reading and the content can be more
easily absorbed. It also makes it easier to re-read the text at a later
time. Three forms of annotation can be distinguished:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Marking:</strong> Either marking with a highlighter or
underlining with pencil or crayon. You can also use different colors for
different meanings, e.g. red=important, black=“Terms and definitions”,
etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Non-linguistic annotations:</strong> Small symbols can be
used to characterize text passages. This can be done directly in the
text or in the margin. See the table below for examples.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Linguistic notes:</strong> Short remarks and notes on the
contents of a paragraph can be noted directly in the margin. More
detailed thoughts can also be noted on the back of the text.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Markings and annotations should of course only be made on texts that
belong to you personally, not in borrowed books. It therefore makes
sense to either make annotations in the digital version of a text, for
example on a tablet, or to work with copies or printouts. Reading on a
laptop/PC is also possible, but it is often more difficult to
cognitively process what has been read.</p>

<h4 id="sec:skim_reading">»Skim Reading«</h4>
<p>In order to gain an overview of the core contents of a text in a
short time, there are various reading strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Selective reading:</strong> With selective reading only
parts of the text are read. The sections to be read are selected in such
a way that the central information can be captured as far as possible.
If necessary, additional sections can then be consulted. The following
procedure can be used for guidance:</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>First, look at the table of contents, if available. If there is
no table of contents (e.g. for articles), the subheadings can be
consulted. In this way it can be seen how the author has arranged the
topic and which sections of the text are relevant for your own
work.</p></li>
<li><p>Read the introduction or the first section to get an overview of
the question.</p></li>
<li><p>The main part of the text is skipped and instead the conclusion
is read directly. This can be directly related to the questions raised
in the introduction to see what the author concludes.</p></li>
<li><p>Depending upon own question and interests, now further sections
from the main part can be read, in order to reconstruct the argument in
detail.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If you have a specific focus in terms of content or methodology, for
example in relation to a paper or a presentation, the text can be read
from a certain angle and irrelevant passages can be omitted. It can be
helpful to cross out passages that are not thematically relevant with a
pencil. An important additional source of assistance is the keyword
index, if available.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Searching reading:</strong> This type of reading aims to
read a text as quickly as possible and still obtain important
information. You should be clear beforehand which words or terms you
want to find. The text is then searched for them and, if the terms do
not occur, it need not be consulted further.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cursory reading:</strong> Also a fast method. As with the
searching method, more precise details are neglected. The point is to
grasp the broader context and meaning of a text. As a result of this
reading process, it should be clear which questions are addressed in the
text. With this technique, the eyes only scan the text, not reading line
by line. It is recommended to write down one or two key points per
page.</p></li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img alt="Schematic illustration of cursory reading" src="images/Kursorisches_Lesen.png"/>
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Schematic illustration of cursory
reading</figcaption>
</figure>
<div class="Tip">
<p>After having read the text, try again to visualize the “blueprint” of
the text: Where does it begin, where does it go from there, etc.?
Formulate the core thesis for yourself once again. If this works, you
have a reasonably good grasp of the text.</p>
</div>
<p>For optimal preparation for a course assignment or analysis of a
text, you should follow up with a critical discussion after reading.
This can be undertaken as textual criticism: Is the structure coherent?
Are the premises taken up again later? Is the argumentation finished?
(Sensitizing yourself to this can be doubly helpful - such things also
play a decisive role in the marking of your papers). Meanwhile, courses
often specifically ask for objective criticism of the text: are the
premises of the text acceptable? Is the evidence conclusive? What is the
method, if any? Are moral judgements made?</p>
<h4 id="sec:summaries">Summaries</h4>
<p>In order to secure what you have learned on a long-term basis, it
makes sense to write summary of important texts after reading them. On
the basis of your markings and comments, it is easy to see which
passages were felt to be important during reading. In the summary, these
passages are briefly written out in your own words. This summary is a
very valuable tool for working out the line of argumentation of a text
and, if necessary, for detecting weaknesses in its arguments. You can
also make notes regarding your own impressions, agreements and
disagreements with individual passages. If the text has to be referred
to at a later date, the summary can be used to visualize it very
quickly. It is therefore recommended that you always prepare a short
summary of any text you have read, to which you can refer if necessary.
In order to be able to find the summary of a given text quickly, it is
therefore advisable to store the summaries with the bibliographic data
in a database. For more details see the section on <a href="07_Literature_Administration.html#sec:literature_administration">Literature
Administration</a>.</p>
<p>For the summary you can use the following questions as a guide:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>What is the topic of the text?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the author’s main question?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the author’s thesis in relation to that
question?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the author’s argumentation structure?</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="Advice">
<p>A good summary captures in brief the principal content of the text.
It is not a matter of identifying the most important sentences in the
text and copying them into your own document, but of reformulating the
contents into larger main ideas. This is the only way to really make the
text your own and integrate it into your own learning. Depending on the
structure of the text, a graphic rendering of its statements as a
diagram can also be helpful.</p>
