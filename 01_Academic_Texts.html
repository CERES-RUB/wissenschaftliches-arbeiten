  <h1 id="types-of-academic-texts">Types of Academic Texts</h1>
<p>Academia takes place predominantly in the medium of language, and
texts will play a central role in your studies: knowledge is conveyed in
the form of texts, academic sources are read, classified, and acquired.
What has been learned is also presented in written form, e.g. in term
papers (<em>Hausarbeiten</em>) and exams.</p>
<h2 id="sec:assignments">Types of Assignments</h2>
<p>A large component of course assignments are in written form. In order
to be able to meet the requirements of the various kinds of written
assignment, one must be familiar with them. Assignments written during
the course of study differ not only in length, but also in their
purpose, structure and style.</p>
<p>The longest form of assignment - apart from the final thesis - is a
term paper (<em>Hausarbeit</em>). Term papers in BA studies usually
comprise 12-18 pages, whereby usually six pages are credited with 1 CP
each. The term paper represents an independent academic achievement,
something that is reflected in the requirements.</p>
<p>For a term paper a student should work independently on a chosen
topic. This includes the literature consultation and presentation of the
state of research, as well as the formulation of a clear structure and
answering an independently developed research question. A term paper
must also meet certain formal requirements, such as correct citation
style and the creation of a bibliography. For more details see section
<a href="02_Term_Papers.html#sec:term_papers">Term Papers</a>.</p>
<p>A presentation (<em>Referat</em>) has a different objective than a
term paper. It should not so much deal with a question, which was
developed by oneself, but rather give an overview of a certain topic.
However, the formal requirements are the same as for a term paper.</p>
<p>It is sometimes possible to arrange to write a term paper as an
extension of a presentation, which should then address an independently
developed research question. See more details in section <a href="03_Presentations.html#sec:presentations">Lectures and
Presentations</a>.</p>
<p>An essay is a discussion of a given topic. It is less formal and less
strict in structure than a term paper. An explicit structure is not
usually necessary, and the state of research does not have to be
comprehensively presented. If the essay only refers to one or two
sources, the citations can also become less important.</p>
<p>An important feature of the essay is the well-argued examination of a
topic. While questions of structure are less important, stress is
accordingly placed on the quality of argumentation. The essay serves to
test argumentative strategies and to present one’s position. An academic
position is not to be confused with an opinion: the essay should present
a position which the author takes as their own and which is justified
soundly in the essay’s arguments. It thus trains its author to develop
and organize their own ideas, and at the same time to deal critically
with other points of view.</p>
<div class="Tip">
<p>Think about the structure of your arguments before you start writing.
For a clear structure and precise language, it can be helpful to create
a short outline or mind map which can form the central thread of your
writing. This is also useful for term papers or presentations.</p>
</div>
<p>In university, there are also different types of protocols -
experimental or observation protocols in research, but also protocols of
seminars, which usually record a session as a mixture of progress and
result protocols. This ensures that the results of the meeting are
available to all participants, and must therefore be comprehensible to
anyone who was not present at the meeting. They are also often a good
way of giving feedback to the lecturer, showing which components of the
class were absorbed and understood. Meanwhile, writing protocols is a
good way of making your personal notes as efficient and precise as
possible. A protocol does not have to reflect the course of events in a
strict and detailed manner, rather priority is given to summarizing and
structuring the key points of the seminar/lecture. This may involve
including points made by participants in a class as well as the content
of presentations or a lecture. Record should be included of open
questions that might be formulated at the end of the session, and of any
key sources and/or literature involved. Use of diagrams may often be a
helpful tool.</p>
<div class="Tip">
<p>Write the protocol as soon as possible after the session - your notes
will be more meaningful when the memory is still fresh! If you have any
questions or difficulties in understanding, contact the lecturer or the
presenters as soon as possible, preferably directly after the
session.</p>
</div>
<p>Like the protocol, the text summary or excerpt does not constitute an
independent academic achievement. The aim of a summary is instead to
reproduce the core statements of a text in as concise and precise a form
as possible. For more details see the section <a href="04_Literature.html#sec:summaries">Summaries</a>.</p>
<p>There are additional forms of written assignment. These can be, for
example, reviews, posters or Wikipedia articles. In all cases it is
advisable to discuss the performance requirements with the lecturer in
order to avoid any misunderstandings.</p>
<div class="Advice">
<p>The following information must be included in the document header of
all written assignments in this or a similar form:</p>
<p>Ruhr-Universität Bochum</p>
<p>Center for Religious Studies (CERES)</p>
<p>Course of Studies: MA Religious Studies</p>
<p>&lt;Name of the course&gt; &lt;Semester&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Name of the lecturer&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;name of the author(s)&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Date&gt;</p>
</div>
<h2 id="sec:forms">Forms of Academic Literature</h2>
<p>In addition to the assignments to be written by students themselves,
texts written by scholars play a central role in their studies. Such
academic literature can take a variety of forms:</p>
<p>The classic form of the academic text is the monograph, the
independent book. Monographs are written by one or more authors on a
particular topic. The major academic qualifications such as the doctoral
thesis and the habilitation thesis are published in the form of
monographs.</p>
<p>An anthology or edited volume is a collection of essays by different
authors based around an overall topic. Usually, one refers to individual
articles from an anthology, not to the volume as a whole.</p>
<p>Periodicals or journals contain various articles by different
authors. The only thing they have in common is often the subject area of
the journal itself, but there also exist special issues of journals on a
particular theme. Such issues are thus very similar to anthologies.</p>
<p>Manuals differ from anthologies in that the articles they contain are
not primarily current research contributions by the authors, rather they
present the state of research on a given topic. Also, the articles in
manuals are usually shorter.</p>
<p>Dictionaries contain a large number of short articles, usually sorted
alphabetically.</p>
<p>Another category is reviews, whether of monographs, anthologies or
other works. They contain both a brief description of the content of the
reviewed work and a critical analysis thereof with regard to the current
state of research.</p>
