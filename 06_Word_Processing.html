  <h1 id="sec:word_processing">Word Processing</h1>
<p>The mode of production of academia is the writing of texts.
Therefore, a good word processor is an important tool. But it is also
important to use the possibilities of the corresponding applications.
The training period is quickly compensated for by convenient features
such as automatically generated tables of contents.</p>
<h2 id="sec:office">Office Applications</h2>
<p>Office word processors are the most common, especially Microsoft
Word. Equal (or even superior) to this for most applications for
academic work is the program Writer from the LibreOffice package. The
latter is also attractive for students because it can be downloaded free
of charge.</p>
<p>Office word processors offer a comfortable possibility to enter texts
directly in the way they will (probably) look later in print. However,
this tempts one to fixate on the formal appearance of one’s output.
Later on, this can make corrections and formatting changes more
difficult. Therefore, some details for the use of these programs must be
observed.</p>
<div class="Technology">
<p>Word processors save documents by default in their own formats, which
cannot be reopened everywhere. If you send papers to lecturers or fellow
students, please note the information in the section <a href="06_Word_Processing.html#sec:file_formats">File Formats</a>.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Microsoft Word</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft Word is a popular word processing program and part of the
“Microsoft Office” program package. Microsoft Office is sold in
different versions with different features, usually including at least
Microsoft Word (word processing), Microsoft Excel (spreadsheets) and
Microsoft PowerPoint (presentations). Microsoft Office is available for
the Windows and MacOSX operating systems.</p>
<p>As a student of RUB, you can use Microsoft Office 365 free of charge
as long as you are enrolled. For more information see <a class="uri" href="https://www.it-services.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/services/software/microsoft.html.de">https://www.it-services.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/services/software/microsoft.html.de</a>.</p>
<p><strong>LibreOffice Writer</strong></p>
<p>LibreOffice Writer is a word processing program and part of the
LibreOffice program suite. LibreOffice includes Writer (word
processing), Calc (spreadsheet), Impress (presentations) and other
components for graphics, mathematical formulas and databases. Unlike
Microsoft Office, LibreOffice is available free of charge as open source
software. You can use it freely even after leaving the university.
LibreOffice is available for the operating systems Windows, MacOSX,
Linux and others.</p>
<p>For further information and downloads see <a class="uri" href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">https://www.libreoffice.org/</a>.</p>
<h3 id="paragraph-styles">Paragraph Styles</h3>
<p>The key to using word processors are the paragraph styles. These
allow you to assign not only a certain formatting to text parts
(e.g. font size 14pt, bold font), but also a meaning (e.g. first-order
headline). This allows among other things:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Later, you can change formatting in a single stroke (e.g. all
headings of the first order, font size 16pt),</p></li>
<li><p>automatic table of contents,</p></li>
<li><p>reference to other chapters that are automatically updated
(e.g. “see Chapter 3, page 12”).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, you should immediately get into the habit of always using
a template instead of setting formatting directly. This applies not only
to headings, but also to block quotations, footnotes, and others.</p>
<h3 id="automatic-tables-of-contents">Automatic Tables of Contents</h3>
<p>To ensure that the information in the table of contents actually
corresponds to the page numbers in the document, it is recommended to
use automatic tables of contents. These can automatically create a
directory of chapters based on the templates for headings. When changes
are made in the document, the table of contents is also updated
automatically.</p>
<p>It is also recommended to use so-called “fields” for references in
the text (e.g. to other chapters), which are also updated automatically.
And the page numbers themselves should always be updated
automatically.</p>

## LaTeX {#sec:latex}

The typesetting system LaTeX is an alternative to common word processors. It can also be downloaded free of charge. Its use takes a lot of getting used to at the beginning and requires considerably more training time than a conventional word processor. This is compensated for by a number of advantages. Some problems which cannot be solved at all in the common word processors are almost always treatable in in LaTeX. In addition, LaTeX documents look much more professional than documents from conventional word processors, even in the default settings.

The big difference between LaTeX and other word processors is that you don't write directly in a page view, rather special formatting commands are entered. If you know HTML, you will be familiar with this. The advantage of this approach is that you always have full control over formatting, whereas with classical word processors formatting is always done in the background, which is not always traceable. The disadvantage is that you have to learn the formatting commands first.

**LaTeX**

Getting started with LaTeX can be a bit confusing as LaTeX consists of different, independent components. To use LaTeX you need three components first:

1. A LaTeX distribution, which includes the basic program and some helpful additional packages,

2. A text editor, which is used to write the input file with the LaTeX commands (this is basically possible with any simple text editor, but specialized LaTeX editors offer some comfort functions), and

3. An output file viewer, usually a PDF viewer.

The distribution "TeXLive" includes all necessary components and can be downloaded from <http://www.tug.org/texlive/>. TeXLive is available for Windows, MacOSX, Linux and other systems.
-->
<h2 id="sec:file_formats">File Formats</h2>
<p>As long as documents are only used on your own computer and only
passed on in printed form, it is quite irrelevant in which format the
files are stored. Every application has a preset format, which can be
used for its own purposes without any problems.</p>
<p>However, if you pass on documents electronically, e.g. because you
are sending your paper to the lecturer by e-mail, you must pay attention
to the file format used. It cannot be assumed that the lecturer will use
the same program as you, and not all applications can read all
formats.</p>
<p>In order to avoid unnecessary problems, the following guidelines
should therefore be followed:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If a text does not require editing by the recipient (which is
usually the case when sending papers to lecturers), PDF format is
recommended. <strong>PDF</strong> files can be viewed on practically any
computer and look the same everywhere. However, PDF files cannot be
easily edited. In order for the lecturer to be able to make comments in
the document, it can be useful to send an editable version of the
document (see below).</p></li>
<li><p>If a document is to be further processed by the recipient, a word
processing format is recommended. However, some problems may occur:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Different settings may result in different page breaks than the
author intended.</p></li>
<li><p>The fonts used must be available on the recipient’s computer to
obtain the same display. This is not always the case, especially with
non-latin language characters (Hebrew, Arabic, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>The recommended file format is currently the “docx” format of
Microsoft Word. Due to its wide distribution, it can also be read by
other word processors, such as LibreOffice. The ODT file format is also
possible as an exchange format. It is already used as a standard format
by LibreOffice and is also supported by Microsoft Word. The older “doc”
format of Microsoft Word is outdated and vulnerable to potential
security issues. It should no longer be used. In case of doubt, ask the
recipient which format they prefer.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not use formats that are specific to a certain application or
operating system, like Apple’s “Pages” format.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
